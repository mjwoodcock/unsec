This is a quick knock up of a tool to extract self extracting archives from ROOL (www.riscosopen.co.uk).

So far, it is very quick and dirty.  The file format was derived over a 10 minute investigation.  It has been tested under Linux only.

compress.c is taken from nspark.  I'll try feeding the changes back if I can work out who maintains it these days.

It will probably only work with archives created on or after 13 Feb 2010.

TODO
====
Understand file format better, to make the code tidier.
Set correct date on created files.
Have an option to stop file types being appended to file names.
Have an option to list file in an archive without extracting anything.
Have an option to extract specific files.
Port to Windows.
